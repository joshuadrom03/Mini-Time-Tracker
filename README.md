A simple web app to track tasks and hours worked...

## Setup and Run Instructions

### Prerequisites

- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/mini-time-tracker.git
   cd mini-time-tracker
Install dependencies:

bash

npm install
# or
yarn install

Start the development server:

npm run dev
# or
yarn dev

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 (or the URL shown in terminal).

Assumptions and Trade-offs

State management: Used React Context for simplicity instead of Redux or other libraries.
Unique task IDs: Used crypto.randomUUID() for ID generation, assuming modern browser support.
Form validation: Basic required field checks are implemented; no advanced validation or error messages.
UI/UX: Minimal styling focused on functionality; accessibility and responsiveness could be improved.
Persistence: No backend or local storage; all data is lost on page reload.

What I'd Improve With More Time

Add persistent storage (e.g., localStorage or backend API) to save tasks across sessions.
Implement full CRUD operations with better UX (e.g., inline editing, confirmation modals).
Add detailed form validation with user-friendly error messages.
Enhance styling for responsiveness and accessibility compliance.
Add unit and integration tests for components and context logic.
Optimize performance, especially for large task lists.
Support user authentication for multiple users.
